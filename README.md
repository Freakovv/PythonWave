# PythonWave: Immerse yourself in the wave of knowledge of the python programming language
My first small project for course work on an academic subject
"Fundamentals of algorithmization and programming"

Topic: “Creation of a software tool in the educational subject “Instrumental Software” for studying theoretical material and solving basic problems with the possibility of verification”

The project plans to deploy the following functionality:

- Authorize and register users 
- Implement the ability to view and edit the user’s personal information
- Development of theoretical material for courses with the ability to create notes in the provided material
- Implement the ability to complete practical tasks in the form of solving problems using the Python language interpreter and providing results on completed tasks
- Develop a forum view of possible solutions to other users' problems
- Generate reports on completing practical assignments for a specified period of time
- Provide for export of reports
- Ensure the organization of a concise interface of the software by creating menus, button forms, and toolbars
- Implement the appropriate class hierarchy, work with information
- Create an application help system
- The program must save data to file(s) in *.docx, *.txt and (or) *.bin formats, and read data from them

Development stack: C++, WinForms, Python, SQL
